# Real-time rendering, 4th edition study

###### Presentation slides, resources and references of ["Real-time rendering, 4th Edition"](http://www.realtimerendering.com/) Book

## The Book

Thoroughly updated, this fourth edition focuses on modern techniques used to generate synthetic three-dimensional images in a fraction of a second. With the advent of programmable shaders, a wide variety of new algorithms have arisen and evolved over the past few years. This edition discusses current, practical rendering methods used in games and other applications. It also presents a solid theoretical framework and relevant mathematics for the field of interactive computer graphics, all in an approachable style.
